## What is it? 
Cross-platform monitoring script written in Python. 

## What I like about it? 
Very easy install. pip3 install glances --user. As the name suggests, it's like viewing htop, bmon, atop/dtop/iotop at a glance. It can be invoked to output to your shell, web, or output to many different formats/engines. Could see using this as a way to output relevant information to TFT/LCD on a Raspberry Pi. 

## What I don't like about it? 
As the name suggests, it gives you a glance, so you need to make your own system to monitor trends and setup alerts, it can be used to monitor
multiple devices, but the interface seems to be built initially for individual systems.
