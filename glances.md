## What is it? 
Cross-platform monitoring script written in Python. 

## What I like about it? 
Very easy install. pip3 install glances --user , and you're good to go. As the name suggests, it's like viewing htop, bmon, atop/dtop/iotop 
at a glance. I can view it via shell, web, or output to many different formats/engines. 


## What I don't like about it? 
As the name suggests, it gives you a glance, so you need to make your own system to monitor trends and setup alerts, it can be used to monitor
multiple devices, but the interface seems to be built initially for individual systems.
