## What is it? 
Open source uptime monitor and status page powered by GitHub actions, issues and pages. 

## What I like about it? 
This is one of the easiest way to start monitoring websites that you are responsible for. Not only can it tell you if your website is up or not, but it can also tell you if it's taking too long to respond. It creates an issue when there is one, and can be configured to notify you in many different ways.

## What I don't like about it? 

Not good for detailed historical analysis of longer than a week, or of anything running on non standard ports (80 and 443 only).q
