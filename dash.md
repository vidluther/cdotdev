## What is it? 
A very simple web dashboard for Linux. 

## What I like about it? 
Clean interface, and it gives you the basics for one system easily. This is great if you just want a simple dashboard of just one device. 

## What I don't like about it? 

Not really designed for aggregating data for multiple systems. So, this isn't really scalable when you have more than one server/system to monitor.
