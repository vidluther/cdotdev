## What is it? 
Open source, self hosted system/resource monitoring service. 

## What I like about it? 

Old and trusted system/collection of plugins that just work, easy to setup with Ansible and other "dev ops" tools. Just specify one with a role of munin or munin master, and then specify the rest as munin nodes. 


## What I don't like about it? 

Not nearly as realtime like newer tools like NetData.
