## What is it? 
Real time monitoring for all your infrastructure. 


## What I like about it? 
Easy to get up and running, setup script even configured module to monitor my Pi-hole install.  Completely free to use right now, allows per agent/node monitoring on port 19999, or consolidated view with NetData Cloud.

## What I don't like about it? 

Unclear on cost, so not sure how expensive it can get in the future.  Alerting and notifications require editing text files and using their edit-config script.
