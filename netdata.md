## What is it? 
Real time monitoring for all your infrastructure. 


## What I like about it? 
Easy to setup, setup script automatically configured module to monitor my Pi-hole install, so auto service discovery is a plus. Completely free to 
use right now, allows per agent/node monitoring on port 19999, or consolidated view with NetData Cloud.

## What I don't like about it? 

Unclear on cost, so not sure how expensive it can get in the future.  Alerting and notifications require editing text files and using their edit-config script.
